# Tax-Calculator
This is a simple Java project to calculate tax by 5%
I'm still learning java so this is my first project, it seems not good but I atleast made a working one
More and more will be published soon!

## Change tax value
You can change it where it is defined by `double tax = 0.05` (don't put it 5/100 or won't work)
